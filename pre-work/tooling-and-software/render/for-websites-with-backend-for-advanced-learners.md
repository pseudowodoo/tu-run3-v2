# For Websites with Backend (For Advanced Learners)

## Creating a Web Service (For webapps with a NodeJS Backend)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is for users who do intend to have a Node JS backend for their webapp. It will allow you to create a static site. This is the default mode for TechUp participants.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

### Deploying my Web App with a NodeJS Backend

#### 1. Open Render Dashboard ([https://dashboard.render.com](https://dashboard.render.com/)) and click on New Web Service.

Note that, at this step, you may be asked to enter your **credit card details** to verify your identity; without which, you cannot proceed.&#x20;

We would recommend that you proceed to do so. For the programme, you should not be incurring any expenses from the use of Render, as we will be using the **free plan** by default. That said, should you be using a paid plan for improved functionality, you should also be able to claim for reimbursement, as each participant has been [allocated a $100 budget](../tooling-claims-instructions.md) for tooling purposes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### 6. Your application is now successfully deployed!
