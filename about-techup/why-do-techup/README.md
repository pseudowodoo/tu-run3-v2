# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Why do TechUp

### SN Group Mission <a href="#sn-group-mission" id="sn-group-mission"></a>

> ‚ÄúMany countries and cities have similar ambitions to become smart nations or smart cities. The concepts and ideas vary. For us, being a smart nation is not about flaunting glitzy technology, but it is about applying technology to solve real world problems that will make a difference to people‚Äôs lives, and across the whole of society.‚Äù

> _Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong_

Our core mission as SN is to apply technology to solve real world problems. In order to deliver on Smart Nation ambition, we need to take training and skills development very seriously to stay relevant.

TechUp aims to equip SN officers with baseline modern technical skills so that officers can effectively apply technology to solve real-world problems.

The goals are for every SN officer to:

1. Have a basic understanding of modern technology
2. Adopt an agile, iterative, problem-solving mindset, and
3. Connect with other teams and members of SN.
