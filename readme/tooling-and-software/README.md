* You are highly encouraged to download the Google Chrome browser ([https://www.google.com/intl/en\_sg/chrome/](https://www.google.com/intl/en\_sg/chrome/)) if you haven’t done so already, as the developer tools work much better with Chrome than with Safari or Internet Explorer. Please also ensure that the computer you are using has administrator permissions to download additional software as needed during the TechUp programme.
