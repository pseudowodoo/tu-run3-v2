### For Advanced Participants <a href="#for-advanced-participants" id="for-advanced-participants"></a>

Advanced participants can challenge yourself to do one or more of the following:

1. Automated monitoring for their web app (e.g. using Datadog or Uptime Robot)
2. Implement Continuous Integration and Development (CI/CD) - write test cases that run automatically each time their app gets deployed, to help them catch errors
3. Use an automated security testing tool to prove that their web apps are secure
4. Web app can address a real existing problem statement contributed by other public service agencies
