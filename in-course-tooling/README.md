# üõ†Ô∏è IN-COURSE TOOLING

During the course, you are expected to use more tools to effectively participate in the TechUp Programme's learning activities. As these tools involve certain complexity, you are **not** encouraged to create an account into these tools in advance. Your instructor will work with you in getting onboard these tools during the programme (between weeks 2-3).&#x20;

These tools are:

1. [**Sample Web Application**](sample-web-app.md)\
   This is a sample app containing some source code that will be important for the session on Backend web development (Week 3). \
   &#x20;
2. [**Cloudflare**](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)\
   Cloudflare will be where you purchase a domain name and configure DNS settings. Please read the [Cloudflare Guide](cloudflare.md) for step by step instructions on domain purchasing.\

3. [**Google Analytics**](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision)\
   You will use Google Analytics to analyse traffic to your web app! Please read the [Google Analytics Guide](google-analytics.md) for step by step instruction on installing Google Analytics.\
