*   **What if I donâ€™t have a problem statement?**

    There are plenty of problems to solve! ðŸ™‚ Just look around and see what is bothering you or someone around you in your daily lives. A simple guide to start crafting a problem statement can be found [here](https://www.build.gov.sg/problem-statement-guide/).
*   **Can I change my problem statement halfway?**

    Yes, as long as you are able to build your solution in time for the web app presentation on 19 and 20 Nov 2024.
*   **Does my web app need to solve a problem? What kind of problem?**

    Yes, the deliverable for TechUp is to build your own web app (frontend)  that solves a problem of your choice. The web app you build should meet the requirements stated in [this webpage](../about-techup/expected-deliverables.md).&#x20;
*   **How can I find inspiration on what type of webapp to build?**

    You may find inspiration on the webapps built by our previous run of TechUp participants [here](https://techup.live/).
