{% endhint %}

For you to pass the requirements, your web app will need to demonstrate the following:&#x20;

**A. Technical Requirements:**&#x20;

1. Employ the use of **HTML and CSS** to structure and style the web app to generate an effective interface
2. Employ the use of **Javascript** to allow for interactivity
3. Ensure that the web app has been deployed to the Internet and hosted as a live website using **Render**.&#x20;
4. Have a **custom domain name** and **CDN** purchased from **Cloudflare**
5. Connected to **Google Analytics** so as to track key website data

**B. Broader Requirements:**

1. You have formulated a clear **problem statement**, and that your web app is intended to address this problem.&#x20;
2. You have **developed and tested your prototype** with users, to ascertain that your assumptions/ hypotheses are valid.&#x20;
3. You have incorporated **UX Design principles and elements** to allow for an intuitive user experience for the intended users.&#x20;

You will be guided on how to meet the above requirements across the TechUp Programme.&#x20;

### For Advanced Participants <a href="#for-advanced-participants" id="for-advanced-participants"></a>

If you possess basic background in technology, or find the above too easy, you are encouraged to challenge yourself to do more with your web app! Examples of ways to challenge yourself further are as follows:&#x20;

1. Creating a backend for the web app, that would allow it to do API calls or database management.&#x20;
2. Automated monitoring for their web app (e.g. using Datadog or Uptime Robot)
3. Implement Continuous Integration and Development (CI/CD) - write test cases that run automatically each time their app gets deployed, to help them catch errors
4. Use an automated security testing tool to prove that their web apps are secure
5. Web app can address a real existing problem statement contributed by other public service agencies
