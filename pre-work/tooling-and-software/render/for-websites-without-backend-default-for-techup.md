# For Websites without Backend (Default for TechUp)

## Creating a Static Site (For webapps without Backend)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is for users who do **not** intend to have a backend for their webapp. It will allow you to create a static site. This is the default mode for TechUp participants.&#x20;

If you&#x20;
{% endhint %}

**1. Open Render Dashboard (**[**https://dashboard.render.com**](https://dashboard.render.com/)**) and click on New Static Site.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that, at this step, you may be asked to enter your **credit card details** to verify your identity; without which, you cannot proceed.&#x20;

We would recommend that you proceed to do so. For the programme, you should not be incurring any expenses from the use of Render, as we will be using the **free plan** by default. That said, should you be using a paid plan for improved functionality, you should also be able to claim for reimbursement, as each participant has been [allocated a $100 budget](../tooling-claims-instructions.md) for tooling purposes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### 4. Congrats, your website should now start building and successfully deployed!
