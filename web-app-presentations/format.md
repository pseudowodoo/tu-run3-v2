### Detailed Web App Requirements <a href="#detailed-web-app-requirements" id="detailed-web-app-requirements"></a>

As earlier mentioned in the [TechUp Deliverables](../techup-challenge/expected-deliverables.md) section, at the end of TechUp you will need to present your web app that meets the following requirements:

1. **Articulate a user problem**

* Clearly identify and describe a specific problem or need that users face, which your web app aims to address or solve. This should serve as the driving force behind the development of your app.
* _In plain English: There is a clear problem that your web app is solving, in one sentence._

1. **Use CSS to design and style page**

* Implement visually appealing and cohesive design elements throughout the web app. This includes layout structuring, colour schemes, typography, and overall aesthetic enhancements.
* _In plain English: Your web app is not jarring or ugly at first glance. You have chosen decent colours, fonts, sizes and layout that is not unpleasant._

1. **Interactivity with Javascript**

* Implement interactive features and functionalities using JavaScript. This could involve dynamic content updates, form validation, event handling, and other client-side scripting techniques to provide interactivity.
* _In plain English: When you click a button, something happens on your web app (that is not just taking you to another web page)._

1. **Intuitive UX flow**

* Design a clear and intuitive user experience (UX) flow for your web app, encompassing navigation structure, User Interface (UI) design and information presentation.
* _In plain English: Your user can easily understand how to use the web app to efficiently accomplish their tasks/goals._

1. **Reading and writing into a database (optional)**

* Optionally, integrate functionality to read and write data into a database. This could involve storing user information, managing content, or any other data persistence requirements that support the core functionality of the web app.
* _In plain English: you can read, write, update and/or delete data from a database._

**In addition, the web app MUST be deployed to the Internet, and hosted as a live website using** [**Render**](https://info.techup.live/admin-instructions/tooling-and-software/render) **with a purchased domain name and CDN using** [**Cloudflare**](../in-course-tooling/cloudflare.md)**.** In other words, your web app cannot just be hosted on your local computer without being hosted on the Internet. Your web app should also be connected to **Google Analytics**.

### Objective <a href="#objective" id="objective"></a>

**The primary objective of the web app presentations is to receive feedback as part of the learning process,** as a culmination of the knowledge and skills you have built up over the month of TechUp.

Your web apps serve as a tangible representation of your learning journey, showcasing your ability to apply theoretical concepts like design thinking and web development to real-world projects.

### Presentation Details <a href="#presentation-details" id="presentation-details"></a>

You will be divided into your Learning Groups for your web app presentations over a 2-hour slot (see [Presentation Schedule](presentation-schedule.md)).

The presentations will be attended by some instructors/stakeholders (e.g. MCI Products Directorate Director Chen Kaiwei / DD Li Zheng; OGP's Policy and Product leaders).

**Each participant will have 5 minutes to:**

1. State their problem statement
2. Click through the web app to show what their web app does (please have your web app open for this segment)
3. Explain what user research they did to confirm the problem statement, make adjustments to the web app along the process etc. (if any)
4. Explain how their JavaScript code in their web app works (please navigate to show the room your code for this segment).

Slides are not necessary, but you are welcome to show them if you have any.

Our panel will then ask any clarifying questions and give feedback on your engineering, design and product considerations for around 5 minutes. 😄

### Pass Criteria <a href="#pass-criteria" id="pass-criteria"></a>

TechUp is the baseline, minimum requirement for tech policy officers in DTC.

If you meet all 4 mandatory criteria above (and your web app is live on the Internet and connected to a domain name), you will have deemed to have passed TechUp and will receive a graduation certificate. Congratulations! 👏 This is but the start of a lifelong journey of learning about this fast-evolving domain.

If you require more time or have any exigencies to take care of on 27 or 28 May, fret not. You will have a **6-month grace period** to run through the materials again before presenting your completed web app at a subsequent make-up session 6 months later. _Please approach the organising committee to let us know and we will schedule you for a make-up presentation._
