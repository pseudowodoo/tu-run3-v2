# ðŸ“± Expected Deliverables

Build your own web app that solves a problem of your choice. The web app you build should meet the requirements below. You are required to present your web app on either 19th or 20th November. More details will be shared with you soon.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

For you to pass the requirements, your web app will need to demonstrate the following:&#x20;

**A. Product-level Requirements:**

1. You have clearly formulated a **robust problem statement**, and that your web app clearly is aimed to address this problem, through its features and design.&#x20;
2. You have **developed and tested your prototype** with users, to ascertain that your assumptions/ hypotheses are valid.&#x20;
3. You have incorporated **UX Design principles and elements** to allow for an intuitive user experience for the intended users.&#x20;

**B. Hard Technical Requirements:**&#x20;

For your app to score a passing grade, your app should also demonstrate the following:

1. Use of **HTML and CSS** to structure and style the web app to generate an effective interface
2. Use of **Javascript** to allow for some elements of interactivity
3. It has been deployed to the Internet and hosted as a live website using **Render**.&#x20;
4. Have a **custom domain name** and **CDN** purchased from **Cloudflare**
5. Connected to **Google Analytics** so as to track key website data

You will be guided on how to meet the above requirements across the TechUp Programme.&#x20;

### For Advanced Participants <a href="#for-advanced-participants" id="for-advanced-participants"></a>

If you possess basic background in technology (e.g., you hold a computer science degree), or find the above too easy, you are encouraged to challenge yourself to do more with your web app! Examples of ways to challenge yourself further are as follows:&#x20;

1. Creating a backend for the web app, that would allow it to do API calls or database management.&#x20;
2. Automated monitoring for their web app (e.g. using Datadog or Uptime Robot)
3. Implement Continuous Integration and Development (CI/CD) - write test cases that run automatically each time their app gets deployed, to help them catch errors
4. Use an automated security testing tool to prove that their web apps are secure
5. Web app can address a real existing problem statement contributed by other public service agencies
