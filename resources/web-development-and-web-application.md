### Full Stack

{% hint style="info" %}
[Full stack development is the process of developing both the frontend and backend of applications. Any application has a frontend (user-facing) component and a backend (database and logic) component.](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/full-stack-development/)

### Front End <a href="#front-end" id="front-end"></a>

The **front end** (sometimes called **client side**) of a web app refers to the visible part of website or web application which is responsible for user experience. The user directly interacts with the front end portion of the web application or website.

### Backend <a href="#backend" id="backend"></a>

The **back end** refers to the **server-side** development of web application or website with a primary focus on how the website works. It is responsible for managing the database through queries and APIs by client-side commands.
