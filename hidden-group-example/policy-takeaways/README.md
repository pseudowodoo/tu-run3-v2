# Learning Points

### [How The Internet Works](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12su5WrpCPGDdJFkRA7WuCRqmAMv29bTyg\_pXOxgYJqg/edit?usp=sharing) <a href="#how-the-internet-works" id="how-the-internet-works"></a>

1. **Servers.** New paradigms: **Cloud** is more secure, more scalable and cheaper than on premise
   1. In an age where the Internet is borderless, "data sovereignty" or "digital sovereignty" means known **where your information is routed to and stored**, e.g. locally or internationally
2. **Addressing.** ICANN and other regulatory bodies decide the allocation of IP addresses and domains, who then farm them out to governments or private sector bodies.
3. **Content Delivery Network (CDN).** The Internet by default has built in multiple redundancies, with multiple copies of Internet pages all over the world. Even if one server goes down, rest of the Internet does not go down.

### [Design Thinking Workshops](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t6GhtbrqaatBF4sEKQwV7tKkTy\_vjYQyTrHnjLmkRPw/edit?usp=sharing) <a href="#design-thinking-workshops" id="design-thinking-workshops"></a>

1. Coming up with a good problem statement is not just applicable to
2. We had gone through the design thinking process, where direct user feedback is very important to iterate on products. Unlike traditional policy environments, **this iteration is possible in digital**, because of how quickly changes can be made (e.g. styling, content) and propagated to live apps.

### [HTML](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dCoYu3hbezjPL7Sv-eb4sg6YMp8uRyzfno0\_1mKgA7U/edit?usp=sharing) <a href="#html" id="html"></a>

1. Many aspects of the Internet's protocols, standards and software are **open source** and a product of **collective, collaborative effort** across many decades.
   1. This was one of the fundamental principles of the design of the Internet's distributed, decentralised infrastructure, so no one entity has unilateral control over its infrastructure and protocols, promoting trust and reliability.
2. Relatedly, there is no point trying to make your HTML code secret as the source code of all HTML pages on the Internet can be viewed by right clicking -> 'Inspect'.
3. Of course, certain secrets like proprietary algorithms, API keys, passwords need to be kept very safe. But a lot of what is available on the Internet is **publicly accessible and open source**.

### [CSS](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15hGVuy630iMFga7RZD77Bft9JhJNuKbETMtiMCJxWwI/edit?usp=sharing) <a href="#css" id="css"></a>

1. The **separation of concerns** in web development involves dividing different aspects of a web application into distinct sections, each responsible for a specific part of the functionality. HTML is responsible for structure and content, while CSS is for presentation and styling.
   1. This allows each layer (HTML, CSS) to be clearly read, updated independently and in parallel, and reused across different documents.
2. We had gone through the design thinking process, where direct user feedback is very important to iterate on products. Unlike traditional policy environments, **this iteration is possible in digital**, because of how quickly changes can be made (e.g. styling, content) and propagated to live apps.
   1. Tech companies spend large amounts of time and money to get these small changes right to drive the outcomes and behaviours they want, e.g. buttons, logos, layout.

### [JavaScript](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CXiN0koSylM\_22-HZmxboNmfmtafJOjQjbqyUOIJQqM/edit?usp=sharing) <a href="#javascript" id="javascript"></a>

1. Once again, **separation of concerns** means that different parts of an application can be worked on at the same time. In particular, many companies divide their software engineers across frontend and backend engineering. We have touched backend (Node.js to run the script.js) for the first time.
2. JavaScript is designed to handle **events** such as user inputs, clicks, and other actions, making web pages responsive and interactive. This is what gives 'functionality' to the website beyond a static site.
3. Features like callbacks, promises, and async/await allow JavaScript to perform tasks asynchronously, crucial for handling **operations like API calls** without freezing the user interface.
