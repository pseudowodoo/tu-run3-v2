# ðŸ“± Deliverables & Milestones

## **Your TechUp Challenge**&#x20;

In the TechUp Programme, your end goal would be to develop a **functional web application** **that solves a problem of your choice**. To do so, you will need to wear the following hats throughout the course:&#x20;

* _Product Manager_: who perceptively identify the right needs/ problems and, in an agile manner, develops a suitable product in service of these needs
* _UX Designer_: who employs an iterative, experimental and human-centered approach in product design to build a product that is attuned to serving its end-users
* _Web App Developer_: who employs computational thinking and coding skills to translate design and product ideas into an actual product for use.&#x20;

All TechUp Participants must complete this challenge before they could be deemed as having passed this programme.&#x20;

## **Your Milestones (the 3Ps)**&#x20;

To achieve this goal, there are three milestones (the _3P's_) that await you in this TechUp journey:&#x20;

1. _Milestone 1_: Define the Right **Problem**\
   A good product is defined by the kind of problem that it's intended to solve. Have you identified a problem that is clearly defined and scoped, for a clear group of target users; and which merits solving?  \
   \

2. _Milestone 2_: **Prototype** your Idea towards Success\
   _Nobody_ builds a product right at the first try. To ensure that your hypotheses about your intended product's desirability are valid, you will need to build workable prototypes and, importantly, _test_ them with actual users to gather key insights that could shape your ideas towards building a stronger product. \
   \

3. _Milestone 3_: Build and Showcase your **Product**\
   Now it's time to start putting your ideas into action! With your newfound web development skills, start building your web application that approximates the product idea you have. \

## Important Milestone: The TechUp Quiz (5th Nov)

In addition to the 3 milestones shared earlier, you are expected to pass a short MCQ quiz which will assess your knowledge of the Internet. The quiz's contents will revolve around the mandatory pre-course readings in [this page](../pre-work/mandatory-reading-on-how-the-internet-works.md) (i.e., _How the Internet Works_)

&#x20;This quiz will be conducted around **5th Nov (Tuesday), 11:30AM**. You are expected to attain a score of **70% and above** to be considered to have passed the quiz.&#x20;
