You should have already received the email invite to TechUp’s workspace on Slack, as well as the 2FA authentication email, from IMDA. Please be reminded to change your profile picture once you have set up your account, for our identification purposes.

You are highly encouraged to download Slack on your phone and the laptop which you will be using for easier access during the course. For those of you who are loaning a laptop from us, Slack has already been pre-downloaded for you.

Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with how to use Slack. If you are unfamiliar with Slack, please refer to this [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTuOS8E1LZk), or this [tutorial](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360059928654-How-to-use-Slack--your-quick-start-guide), for a quick guide on Slack’s various features. It is important for you to familiarize yourself with the features of Slack as we will be relying on this tool heavily throughout the course for all communication purposes.
