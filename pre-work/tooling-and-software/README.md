2. [**Github**](https://github.com/signup) \
   You will be using Github and Github Codespaces for storing and editing code. Please read the [Github setup guide](github.md) for step by step instructions.\

3. [**Render**](https://dashboard.render.com/register) (Note: Use the create using GitHub option)\
   You will be using Render as hosting to deploy your web app into cyberspace! Please read the [Render guide](render.md) for step by step instructions on how to setup and deploy a web app.\

#### Additional notes <a href="#additional-notes" id="additional-notes"></a>

* You are highly encouraged to download the Google Chrome browser ([https://www.google.com/intl/en\_sg/chrome/](https://www.google.com/intl/en\_sg/chrome/)) if you haven‚Äôt done so already, as the developer tools work much better with Chrome than with Safari or Internet Explorer. Please also ensure that the computer you are using has administrator permissions to download additional software as needed during the TechUp programme.
